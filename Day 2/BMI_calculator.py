    main()
# This code calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height.
# It categorizes the BMI into underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity.
# The `calculate_bmi` function computes the BMI, and the `bmi_category` function determines the category.
# The `main` function handles user input and displays the results.
# The code includes error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values or zero height.
# The BMI is calculated using the formula: weight (kg) / (height (m) ** 2).
# The BMI categories are defined as follows:
# - Underweight: BMI < 18.5
# - Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 24.9
# - Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 29.9
# - Obesity: BMI >= 30
# The output is formatted to display the BMI value with two decimal places and the corresponding category.
# Example usage:
# Enter your weight in kg: 70
# Enter your height in meters: 1.75
# Your BMI is: 22.86
# You are classified as: Normal weight
# The code is structured to be run as a standalone script, with the main function being executed when the script is run directly.
# The code is designed to be user-friendly, providing clear prompts and error messages.
# It can be easily extended or modified to include additional features, such as saving the results to
# a file or providing more detailed health advice based on the BMI category.
# The code is written in Python and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.
# The code is modular, with separate functions for calculating BMI and determining the category,
# making it easy to test and reuse.
# The code is efficient, with a time complexity of O(1) for the BMI calculation
# and category determination, as they involve simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks.
# The code is robust, handling potential errors gracefully and providing informative feedback to the user.
# The code is compatible with Python 3.x and can be run in any standard Python environment.
# The code is well-documented, with clear comments explaining the purpose of each function and the
# overall flow of the program.
# The code can be easily integrated into larger applications or used as a standalone tool for BMI calculation.
# The code is designed to be easily understandable for beginners while also being efficient and effective for more experienced programmers.
# The code can be further enhanced by adding features such as:
# - Saving the BMI results to a file
# - Providing additional health tips based on the BMI category
# - Allowing users to input multiple weights and heights for batch processing
# - Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience
# The code is a simple yet effective implementation of a BMI calculator,
# demonstrating the use of functions, error handling, and user input in Python.
